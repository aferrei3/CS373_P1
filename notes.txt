So... from looking through the samples and the corresponding output from terminal
it seems like the case where the transition is transitioning to itself when it doesn't
already exist in stateArr is producing some buggy behavior. Gonna have to code for this
case or the whole thing is gonna shit it's pants :/ - probably gonna work more on this
tomorrow it's getting kind of late today might drink some chamomile and relax.

OK seems like other buggy case is when there is a transition to a state does not yet exist
in stateArr but it is not also the from state. Gonna have to fix that too tomorrow.
Otherwise we should be boolin... Hopefully.

Seems like the problem lies between lines 92-108.

Need to figure out if line 83 should be finding states in the array by pointer.
Feel like I remember Mike saying something about this making a copy and not referencing 
the actual value.

Just emailed Mike - remember to check if he responds

Probably gonna have to do the old method where it was a vector containing
vectors - the pairs are probably fucking it up.
